# 2022 NCATS Summer Coding Camp

## Course Goals
The goal of the camp is to provide assisted learning in coding concepts.  The camp tailors to beginner or seasoned computational experts and no previous experience is required.

At the end of this course, participants will have been introduced to GitHub and team coding best practices.  Depending on their level of proficiency in programming prior to starting the camp, the expectation is for participants to have advanced their knowledge and skills in a particular language or application of software/code of their choice.

## Course logistics
### The Basics:
The camp will last 8 weeks and will start June 17th, 2022 and go until August 5th, 2022.  Sessions will meet at 11:00am Eastern on Fridays.  
The camp will be open to all of NCATS (trainees and staff).
The commitment would be 1 hour in-person time per week for 8 weeks, plus at least 3 additional hours/week and ad hoc slacking back and forth.
There will be two introductory lectures: 1) introducing what the camp is about so folks can decide on whether or not to join; 2) introducing the course organization and use of GitHub, and definition of projects.
At the end of the 8 weeks, everyone will share the results of their project (e.g. 15 min talk).
The camp will be capped to 20 participants.

### Teaching Assistants:
Each participant will be choosing a teaching assistant (TA) to work with for the entire 8 weeks. Here are the TAs for this round:
- Andy Patt
- Tim Sheils
- Cole Tindall
- Swazoo Claybon
- Mark Willliams
- Kyle Spencer
- Tongan Zhao
- Ewy Mathe
- Wenyu  Zeng

Some descriptions of potential projects by TAs can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1633tjYx-nPXI-CtK3Qbv69pfxLcdbau7N3FiJ5s66c4/edit#heading=h.1nij4a35parz).


### Working Environment:
We will rely on GitHub and Slack for communication throughout this course.
Our GitHub site is: https://github.com/ncats/2022SummerCodingCamp/.
Our Slack Channel is on the NCATS instance and is called: 2022_summer_coding_camp

Instructions on how to communicate via GitHub and Slack will be provided in the introductory lectures.
